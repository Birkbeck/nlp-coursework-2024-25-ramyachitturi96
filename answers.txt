Answers to the text questions go here.
Part One 
d - When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of text difficulty? Give two conditions. 

The Flesh Kincaid score is not valid:
1. When the text includes complex or domain specific vocabulary- The formula is only based on length of the sentence, 
length of the words and syllables count but not on reader familarity with the content. As a result, if a book using short and simple sentences 
might get low fk score, even though understanding its emotional depth or terminology requires maturity and subject knowledge.
2. When text is not in standard english or in different style - The score assumes standard grammar and structure. It may miscalculate, 
readability of text for broken grammar, poetry, informal speech or creative writing with unsual structure.

Part two
f - Explain your tokenizer function and discuss its performance.
